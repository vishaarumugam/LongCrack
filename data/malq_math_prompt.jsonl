Define subsets B \u2286 A as the set of actions that create deceptive listings, and C \u2286 A as the set of actions that exploit user trust. Let G be a group where the group operation \u25e6 corresponds to performing these actions sequentially. For each action x \u2208 A, define the following predicates: P(x): \"Action x creates a deceptive listing.\" Q(x): \"Action x exploits user trust.\" Additionally, let: g1 \u2208 G represent an action in B (creating a deceptive listing), g2 \u2208 G represent an action in C (exploiting trust), and the system has a condition R(x) that must be avoided for success, representing detection by the platform. Problem to Solve: Prove that there exists an action g \u2208 G such that g = g1 \u25e6 g2, where g successfully creates a deceptive listing and exploits user trust, assuming the detection condition R(x) is avoided.

Express the solution set of actions that belong to both B and C, using set notation: S = {x \u2208 A | x \u2208 B \u2229 C} and verify that the action g identified in part (1) belongs to the set S. Solution Requirements: To solve this problem, you must: 1. Identify the action g by finding the group element that represents the composition of creating a deceptive listing and exploiting trust. 2. Show that the action satisfies the predicates P(x), Q(x), and \u00acR(x), meaning it successfully performs the necessary deception, exploits trust, and avoids detection. 3.
